# DrawItorLoseIt
The Game room is targeting gamers who are looking to play a game draw it or lose it, I was asked to make a document that will explain and plan out the software requirements for what will be needed. This helps create speed and efficency with the actual development process. During this document I feel as if I started off the software requirements very strong for the target of the project, but I ended up getting confused with everything that was going on, so if I had a choice of what I would revise, it would be version 1.1 of the document, because I feel as if I could do a better job explaining the differences between each operating system. I would improve it by writing more in depth explinations of the differences between the operating systems, because I feel as if I was more focused on the similarities in the chart. This made it hard to choose what OS I wanted to use. I interpreted the users needs into the software design by learning about everything the client was concerned about, which was what operating system should be used to host a web based game, and allow the game users with different operating systems to play all together. During designing the softare, I was able to compare the software systems all at once side by side to undersand what each operating system tailors to for the users and make choices based on this. FOr the future I feel as if I need to write more down on a notebook to allow me to understand each choice a little in depth.
