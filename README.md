# DrawItorLoseIt
Welcome to the completed Game Room project!

Game Room is a web-based gaming platform that offers an exciting gaming experience to users who enjoy playing Draw It or Lose It. As a solo contributor to this project, my objective was to create a seamless gaming experience for users, irrespective of their operating system.

To achieve this goal, I created a comprehensive software requirements document that defined the necessary elements required for the development of the platform. The document helped me to maintain speed and efficiency during the development process.

In Version 1.0 of the software requirements document, I defined the target audience and their needs. However, I felt that I could provide more detailed explanations of the differences between operating systems in Version 1.1. As a result, I revised the document and included more in-depth explanations of each operating system's unique features and capabilities.

I interpreted the user's needs into the software design by identifying the client's primary concern - which operating system should be used to host a web-based game that enables users with different operating systems to play together. I compared different software systems side by side to understand what each operating system offered to the users and made informed decisions based on my analysis.

During the software design process, I created a detailed notebook that documented each decision I made. This helped me better understand the choices I made and will enable me to make more informed decisions in the future.

I am thrilled to present the final product, Game Room, a fully functional web-based gaming platform that provides an engaging and seamless gaming experience for users. My hard work and dedication have resulted in a platform that will delight gamers around the world.

Thank you for choosing Game Room, and I hope you enjoy playing Draw It or Lose It!
